  <h2>What is a Dress Code?</h2>
  <p>A school's dress code usually provides detailed guidelines and policies about what students are and are not allowed
    to wear on campus. These rules frequently specify what constitutes appropriate footwear, what constitutes an
    acceptable length for skirts or shorts, whether or not apparel with unpleasant language or imagery is permitted, and
    occasionally they even control haircuts and accessories. In addition to ensuring safety and fostering a positive
    learning atmosphere, dress requirements frequently represent the standards and ideals of the school.

  <h3>Is There a Dress Code?</h3>
  <p>In EBT there is no dress code currently but there has been one before the Covid-19 pandemic. The dresscode included
    a maroon color polo or shirt which can still be viewed around the school's hallways by some of our scholars. Now
    days people have the freedom of expressing themselves with the outfits, of course always being school appropriate.
